      Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, and his family moved to
      Oxford, Mississippi when he was a child. With the outbreak of World War I,
      he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force but did not serve in combat.
      Returning to Oxford, he attended the University of Mississippi for three
      semesters before dropping out. He moved to New Orleans, where he wrote his
      first novel Soldiers' Pay (1925). He went back to Oxford and wrote
      Sartoris (1927), his first work set in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County.
      In 1929, he published The Sound and the Fury. The following year, he wrote
      As I Lay Dying. Later that decade, he wrote Light in August, Absalom,
      Absalom! and The Wild Palms. He also worked as a screenwriter,
      contributing to Howard Hawks's To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep; the
      former film, adapted from a novel by Ernest Hemingway, is the only film
      with contributions by two Nobel laureates.[3] Faulkner's renown reached
      its peak upon the publication of Malcolm Cowley's The Portable Faulkner
      and his being awarded the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature for "his powerful
      and unique contribution to the modern American novel."[4] He is the only
      Mississippi-born Nobel laureate. Two of his works, A Fable (1954) and The
      Reivers (1962), won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Faulkner died from a
      heart attack on July 6, 1962, following a fall from his horse the prior
      month. Ralph Ellison called him "the greatest artist the South has
      produced".
